  <h1>How to Plan a Wedding</h1>
  <p>Planning a wedding is an exciting yet intricate process 
    that requires careful attention to detail and organization. <br>
    Here's a condensed guide to help you navigate through the 
    planning stages:</p>
    <div id="box">
      <div id="one">
        <ul>
          <li>Establish a Budget: Determine how much you're willing to spend and allocate
             funds to different aspects of the wedding such as venue, catering, attire,
              and decorations.</li>

          <li>Create a Timeline: Set a wedding date and work backward to create a timeline
             for booking vendors, sending invitations, and completing other essential tasks.</li>

          <li>Choose a Venue: Select a venue that suits your style and accommodates your guest list.
             Whether it's a rustic barn, a beachfront resort, or a traditional church, ensure it
              aligns with your vision.</li>
          <li>Hire Vendors: Research and book vendors such as photographers, caterers, florists, 
            and musicians. Read reviews, ask for recommendations, and negotiate contracts to secure the best deals.</li>

          <li>Design Décor: Coordinate with a decorator or DIY your décor to reflect your
             theme and personal style. Consider elements like flowers, lighting, centerpieces, and signage.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="two">
        <ul>
          <li>Select Attire: Shop for wedding attire for yourself, your partner, 
            and the wedding party. Schedule fittings and alterations well in advance.</li>
          <li>Plan the Ceremony and Reception: Outline the ceremony proceedings, write vows, and plan the reception timeline including speeches, dances, and cake cutting.</li>
          <li>Finalize Details: Confirm arrangements with vendors, create a seating plan, and prepare wedding favors and guest accommodations.</li>
          <li>Enjoy Your Big Day: Relax and savor every moment of your wedding day, knowing that you've meticulously planned and prepared for this joyous occasion.</li>
          <li>Post-Wedding Tasks: Send thank-you notes, return rentals, and update legal documents with your new marital status.</li>
        </ul>
